# Finding old lime trees in Dresden

This example finds trees of (some species of lime/linden tree) in
Dresden, which are more than 200 years old.

It shows how to load (typed) data from (compressed) CSV files, how to
perform a recursive reachability query, and how to use datatype
built-in to find old trees. It can be modified to use a different
species or genus of plant, and by changing the required age.
