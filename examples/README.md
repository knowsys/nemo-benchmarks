We provide the following examples:
* `lime-trees`: finding old lime trees in Dresden by integrating two different data sources and numeric comparisons
   *(uses: CSV input with numerical data, numerical comparisons)*
* `owl-el`: classification of OWL EL ontologies, possibly directly from the original OWL/RDF file
  *(uses: negation, existential rules, RDF input, CSV input)*
