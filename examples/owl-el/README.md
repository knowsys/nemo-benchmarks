# OWL EL Reasoning

This is the completely unoptimised, literal encoding of the EL
reasoning calculus published in Fig. 3 of Kazakov, Krötzsch, Simančík:
"The incredible ELK" J Autom. Reasoning, 2014

It requires a normalised version of the EL ontology as data. The example data provided here was obtained by normalising an OWL EL version of Galen, but can be swapped for, e.g., a normalised version of SNOMED CT.

For details on, e.g., the nomarmalisation procedure, refer to the
materials provided for the [KR2020
Tutorial](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Rules_KR_Tutorial_2020).
